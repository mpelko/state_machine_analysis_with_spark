# State Machine inspection with Spark

This project contains some minimalistic implementation parallel algorithms in spark. The aims are to:

* Implement the underlying conceptual solutions for the parallel analysis of state machines.
* Compare the performance of Scala and Python.

The project goes together with the [Spark Summit presentation](https://spark-summit.org/eu-2016/events/time-series-analysis-with-spark-in-the-automotive-rd-process/).
